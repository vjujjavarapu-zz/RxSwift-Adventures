Welcome, RxNerds 
I have been inclining towards MVVM and Learning RxSwift and after crossing over the initial learning curve, RxSwift is amazing and powers you with the functional programming concepts into the code both enforcing the code to be functional and at the same time performing better and effective. Well keeping that aside, I decided to write as many RxSwift projects while learning it to may be help fellow nerds to learn or contribute or correct me on the way. So clone the repo playaround with the app let me know if you have any questions via creating an issue or contribute via pull request.
